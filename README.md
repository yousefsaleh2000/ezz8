## Knowledge requirements

## ðŸ”¨ What's next?

Customize this project to make it your own. Implement new features, modify existing ones, or integrate it with other technologies.

## ðŸŽ¨ Where to find everything?

The project is structured as follows:

Pages folder contains the Razor Pages.
wwwroot folder contains the static resources (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript files).
appsettings.json contains the application properties.

### Database

Dynamic spaces can use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html) database.  
The database file is called `database.db`. It is placed inside the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder.  
SQLite connection path to the database is `w3s-dynamic-storage/database.db` which you can use to connect to the SQLite database programmatically.   

---  
**Do not change the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder name or `database.db` file name!**  
**By changing the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder name or `database.db` file name, you risk the space not working properly.**

## ðŸ”¨ Please note

For now, files created/uploaded or edited from within the terminal view will not be backed up or synced.
When you're in the editor, the dev server will automatically be running and any changes you make will automatically restart the app. Once you exit the editor, your app will be served by Kestrel.
